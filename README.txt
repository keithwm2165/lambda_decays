AnalyzePions1.C has 3 plots generated
neg_pion1_1.pdf and neg_pion1_2.pdf are made
with 0.5 as z component of L in code.
neg_pion1_3.pdf has 0.05 as z comp of L.

AnalyzePions2.C is edited of 1.C with beta increased to 0.995
and z component kept at 0.05
outputs neg_pion2.pdf's 
ran 3 times

AnalyzePions3.C is edited to beta as 0.75 and neg_pion3.pdf's 
 ran 3 times


new file to edit the additional histograms isaac said to put in.
Those are the binning before the cut to make sure I get zero across the bins!
this is in AnalyzePions_mult.C

ANalyzePions_mult.C from isaac's recommendation that I try multiple
parameter changes such as beta, the cut, and more statistics.
0.4 for cut, 0.85 beta, and 2000 for pi interval

AnalyzePions_mult2.C has changed to 0.15 cut, 0.95 beta, 1000 pi interval


Analyzepions_logging has dn dphi plot and pol versus phi plot
 (which should be sine wave).
Need to check average L hat and L hat prime.
